----> Let's create an application called part1, navigate to its directory and install the libraries:
# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest part1 -- --template react
cd part1
npm install

----> The application is started as follows:
npm run dev

----> From the root directory of your app, we can run the json-server using the command npx:
npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json
# Let's navigate to the address http://localhost:3001/notes in the browser. We can see that json-server serves the notes we previously wrote to the file in JSON format.
# Ctrl + C to stop.

----> Assuming the api-key is 54l41n3n4v41m34rv0, when the application is started like so:
export VITE_SOME_KEY=54l41n3n4v41m34rv0 && npm run dev // For Linux/macOS Bash
($env:VITE_SOME_KEY="54l41n3n4v41m34rv0") -and (npm run dev) // For Windows PowerShell
set "VITE_SOME_KEY=54l41n3n4v41m34rv0" && npm run dev // For Windows cmd.exe
You can access the value of the key from the import.meta.env object:
const api_key = import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY
// variable api_key now has the value set in startup
